# A Simple node kata seed project

This is just a very basic seed project to get you up and running immediately to tdd a kata.

## To get started immediately:

 * Clone this project to get a local copy to start working on with the following command (replacing `[kataname]` with the project name you want):
 `git clone --depth=1 -o boilerplate https://github.com/nickmeldrum/simple-node-kata-seed.git [kataname]`
 * If you want to be able to push this project back to github, create the github repo and run the following command:
 `git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[kataname].git`
 * install the dependencies with `npm install`
 * run the tests with a watcher with the cmd `npm run watch`
 * start writing tests in test/test.js that use the app in lib/index.js

## To clear out any of the "seed projectyness":

 * fill out name and description properly in package.json (change author info here if you are not me)
 * change this README.md contents probably to be the kata description
 * possibly change the test (`test/test.js`) and app (`lib/index.js`) filenames as they are quite generic
