# A Simple node kata seed project

This is just a very basic seed project to get you up and running immediately to tdd a kata.

## To get started immediately:

 * Fork this project
 * run the tests with a watcher with the cmd `npm run watch`
 * start writing tests in test/test.js that use the app in lib/index.js

## To clear out any of the "seed projectyness":

 * fill out name and description properly in package.json (change author info here if you are not me)
 * change this README.md contents probably to be the kata description
 * possibly change the test (`test/test.js`) and app (`lib/index.js`) filenames as they are quite generic
